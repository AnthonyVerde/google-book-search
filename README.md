# Google Books Search
This fullstack app is built with React, MongoDB, Node, and Express, and utilizes Google's Books API to populate books based on a user's search.

Once the page has loaded, you can type any keyword into the search field and hit 'Search'. A list of books will be populated showing each book's title, author, publish date, and description. You also have the option to save a book to create a list of favorite books. Or, you can check out more information on a book at that book's page on books.google.ca. 

After you have saved a few books, you can go to your Saved Books page (link is in the top nav). Here you'll see all your saved books with the option to delete a book if you'd like.
